## Notes

The greatest and most-time consuming challenge I ran into during this project was working with AutoLayout and constraints. I struggled to understand the concept, and upon finally understanding the concept, I struggled to implement it successfully in my project. Nonetheless, with the support of CodePath staff and supplemental documentation and videos online, I finally resolved the issues I was running into.
